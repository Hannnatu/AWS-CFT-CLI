# AWS CLI Resource Creation Project
This simple project demonstrates how to use AWS CLI to:
- ✅ Create an S3 bucket
- ✅ Launch an EC2 instance

# Before starting this, make sure:
- AWS CLI installed
- AWS credentials configured (`aws configure`)
- Existing EC2 key pair (update the `KEY_NAME` in the script)

#How to use this script
Clone and give permissions by chmod u+x awsresources.sh
./awsresources.sh

#Results 
A new S3 bucket with a unique name
An EC2 instance using the Amazon Linux 2 Image or your desired choice.
